## 📱 APK for Android

To test the app on a physical Android device, you can find the `.apk` file inside the `build/` directory of this repository.

The app is not currently available on TestFlight as my personal Apple Developer account is temporarily inactive. I expect to regain access soon, at which point the app will be uploaded and made available for testing.

## 🚀 Quick Testing with Expo Go

The app works perfectly with **Expo Go** for quick testing and development. You can scan the QR code shown after starting the project with Expo and begin testing immediately on your device.

## ⚙️ Native Build Options

Although the app runs on Expo Go, the project also includes native build configurations. The native Android and iOS folders were generated using `expo prebuild`, allowing you to create full native builds when required.
